Uploaded test sequences and the pipeline script.

To run the pipeline, clone the repository, replace the sequences with the desired sequences and run the following code.
if an alternative reference sequence is needed, replace MN908947.3 with the alternative chromosome name in line 9 and 24 of snp_site_matrix_unix.sh accordingly.

```console
bash snp_site_matrix_unix.sh
```

Matrix.py
Corrected behaviour
Now considers multiallelic sites as single mutations rather than two mutations (reverse + forward) compounded.
Improved functionality
now also outputs a snp-dist matrix for comparison against snp-dists matrix generated by snp-dists.
